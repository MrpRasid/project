**📊 Project Overview** <br>
This project performs comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on employee attrition data to identify key factors driving employee turnover in organizations. Using Python's data science stack, we analyze demographic, job-related, compensation, and tenure factors to understand why employees leave.
 <br> <br>
**🎯 Business Problem** <br>
"Why are employees leaving our organization?" - This analysis helps HR departments and management understand the root causes of employee attrition and develop data-driven retention strategies.
